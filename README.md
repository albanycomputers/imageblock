# Image Block

This module provides a block type to add a simple text snippet with an image
to any region in your layouts.
Image blocks are reusable.
Images can have an alignment set (left/right/center), an image style
applied, they can have a link or title...

There's an overview page for admins to delete unused blocks.
Using Image blocks you can create fancy landing pages or whatever your
fantasy yields.

Please note: the migration path from D7 needs more testing.
It somewhat works but needs improvement.
